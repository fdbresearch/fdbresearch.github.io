          <a>Hardware-conscious data processing systems</a>
        </h4>
        <p>
          Hardware-conscious database systems evaluate queries in milliseconds that take minutes in conventional systems, turning long-running jobs into interactive queries. However, the plethora of hardware-focused tuning techniques creates a design-space that is hard to navigate for a skilled performance engineer and even harder to exploit for modern, code-generating data processing systems. In addition, hardware-conscious tuning is often at odds with other design goals such as implementation effort, ease of use and maintainability -- in particular when developing code-generating database systems. Well-designed programming abstractions are essential to allow the creation of systems that are fast, easy to use and maintainable.
        </p>      

        <p>
          In my talk, I demonstrate how existing frameworks for high-performance, data-parallel programming fall short of this goal. I argue that the poor performance of many mainstream data processing systems is due to the lack of an appropriate intermediate abstraction layer, i.e., one that is amenable to both, traditional data-oriented as well as low-level hardware-focused optimizations.
        </p>

        <p>
        To address this problem, I introduce Voodoo, a data parallel intermediate language that is abstract enough to allow effective code generation and optimization but low-level enough to express many common optimizations such as parallelization, loop tiling or memory locality optimizations. I demonstrate how we used Voodoo to build a relational data processing system that outperforms the fastest state-of-the-art in-memory database systems by up to five times. I also demonstrate how Voodoo can be used as a performance engineering framework, allowing the expression of many known optimizations and even enabling the discovery of entirely new optimizations.

          <a>Compressed Representations of Conjunctive Query Results</a>
        </h4>
        <p>
          Relational queries, and in particular join queries, often generate large output results when executed over a huge dataset.
          In such cases, it is often infeasible to store the whole materialized output if we plan to reuse it further down
          a data processing pipeline. In this talk, we consider the problem of constructing space-efficient compressed representations
          of the output of conjunctive queries, with the goal of supporting the efficient access of the intermediate compressed
          result for a given access pattern. In particular, we will study of an important tradeoff : minimizing the space
          necessary to store the compressed result, versus minimizing the answer time and delay for an access request over
          the result. We present a novel parameterized data structure, which can be tuned to trade off space for answer time.
          This tradeoff allows us to control the space requirement of the data structure precisely, and depends both on the
          structure of the query and the access pattern. We then show how we can use the data structure in conjunction with
          query decomposition techniques, in order to efficiently represent the outputs for several classes of conjunctive
          queries. Finally, we conclude with some exciting open problems in this area.

          <a>Using LogicBlox to build large retail analytics applications</a>
        </h4>
        <p>
          LogiQL is a declarative modeling language for concisely expressing rich data models with powerful constraints and business
          rules. The declarative nature and simple syntax of LogiQL makes it amenable to many different implementation strategies,
          including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            allowing the database to determine how data are stored and indexed;
          </li>
          <li>
            deciding how queries are evaluated and results cached;
          </li>
          <li>
            evaluating concurrent transactions to maximize throughput; and even
          </li>
          <li>
            employing powerful constraint optimization solvers to solve linear and integer programming problems.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This ability to declare a model in a manner that is abstract with respect to implementation strategy is powerful. As a simple
          example, it removes much of the complexity of multi-core programming. It also enables a new approach to programming
          large database applications, especially those requiring complex prescriptive and descriptive analytics. Infor Retail
          has adopted LogiQL (and the LogicBlox platform) to build out our suite of retail forecasting and supply-chain optimization
          products. This talk gives a brief introduction to LogiQL and LogicBlox in the context of several common modeling
          problems in the retail domain.

          <a>Integrating Semantic Web in the Real World: A journey between two cities</a>
        </h4>
        <p>
          An early vision in Computer Science has been to create intelligent systems capable of reasoning on large amounts of data.
          Today, this vision can be delivered by integrating Relational Databases with the Semantic Web using the W3C standards:
          a graph data model (RDF), ontology language (OWL), mapping language (R2RML) and query language (SPARQL). The research
          community has successfully been showing how intelligent systems can be created with Semantic Web technologies,
          dubbed now as Knowledge Graphs.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, where is the mainstream industry adoption? What are the barriers to adoption? Are these engineering and social barriers
          or are they open scientific problems that need to be addressed?
        </p>
        <p>
          This talk will chronicle our journey of deploying Semantic Web technologies with real world users to address Business Intelligence
          and Data Integration needs, describe technical and social obstacles that are present in large organizations, and
          scientific challenges that require attention.

          <p>This talk considers a method for compressing graphs into a smaller graph grammar based on the RePair compression
            scheme. We start by defining the necessary notion of context-free hyperedge replacement grammars using examples.
            We then extend RePair to graphs using this grammar formalism and discuss how the problem of finding non-overlapping
            occurrences appears more difficult on graphs than on strings and trees.

          <p>
            We also give some intuition on graphs that are difficult to compress with HR grammars, present some experimental results

            <a>How to Architect a Query Compiler</a>
          </h4>
          <p>In this talk, we study architecting query compilers. The state of the art in query compiler construction is lagging
            behind that in the compilers field. We attempt to remedy this by exploring the key causes of technical challenges
            in need of well-founded solutions, and by gathering the most relevant ideas and approaches from the PL and compilers
            communities for easy digestion by database researchers. All query compilers known to us are more or less monolithic
            template expanders that do the bulk of the compilation task in one large leap. Such systems are hard to build
            and maintain. We propose to use a stack of multiple DSLs on different levels of abstraction with lowering in
            multiple steps to make query compilers easier to build and extend, ultimately allowing us to create more convincing
            and sustainable compiler-based data management systems. We attempt to derive our advice for creating such DSL
            stacks from widely accepted principles. We have also re-created a well-known query compiler following these ideas
            and report on this effort.</p>

            <a>The Dynamic Yannakakis Algorithm: Compact and Efficient Query Processing Under Updates</a>
          </h4>
          <p>Modern computing tasks such as real-time analytics require refresh of query results under high update rates. Incremental
            View Maintenance (IVM) approaches this problem by materializing results in order to avoid recomputation. IVM
            naturally induces a trade-off between the space needed to maintain the materialized results and the time used
            to process updates.
          </p>
          <p>In this talk, we show that the full materialization of results is a barrier for more general optimization strategies.
            In particular, we present a new approach for evaluating queries under updates. Instead of the materialization
            of results, we require a data structure that allows: (1) linear time maintenance under updates, (2) constant-delay
            enumeration of the output, (3) constant-time lookups in the output, while (4) using only linear space in the
            size of the database. We call such a structure a Dynamic Constant delay Linear Representation (DCLR) for the
            query. We show that Dyn, a dynamic version of the Yannakakis algorithm, yields DCLRs for the class of free-connex
            acyclic CQs. We show that this is optimal in the sense that no DCLR can exist for CQs that are not free-connex
            acyclic. Moreover, we identify a sub-class of queries for which Dyn features constant-time update per tuple and
            show that this class is maximal. An experimental validation of Dyn shows that it is highly effective in practice.</p>
          <p>The talk will conclude with current insights on ongoing research on how Dyn can be extended to also allow processing
            of more general classes of queries, in particular queries that feature in-equality joins rather than equality
            joins. Such in-equality joins are important in relational-style queries, but are also prominently present in
            the area of Complex Event Recognition.</p>

            <a>Decision-theoretic planning via probabilistic programming</a>
          </h4>
          <p>We study planning in Markov decision processes involving discrete and continuous states and actions, and an unknown
            number of objects. Planning in such domains is notoriously challenging and often requires restrictive assumptions.
            We introduce HYPE: a sample-based planner for hybrid domains that is very general, which combines model-based
            approaches with state abstraction. Most significantly, the domains where such planners are deployed are usually
            very complex with deep structural and geometric constraints. HYPE is instantiated in a probabilistic programming
            language that allows compact codification of such constraints.</p>
          <p>In our empirical evaluations, we show that HYPE is a general and widely applicable planner in domains ranging from
            strictly discrete to strictly continuous to hybrid ones. Moreover, empirical results showed that abstraction
            provides significant improvements.</p>
          <p>In the final part of the talk, we turn to the question of whether there is any hope of developing computational
            methodologies that are not based on sampling. In particular, it is tricky in hybrid domains to deal with low-probability
            observations, and most sampling-based schemes only provide asymptotic guarantees.</p>

          <p>This talk overviews recent results on bounding the output size and on efficiently evaluating a disjunctive datalog
            rule, given input statistics such as relation sizes, functional dependencies, and degree bounds. These are the
            kind of statistics prevalent in database query evaluation, and our results apply to aggregate queries as well.
            The disjunctive datalog query evaluation problem is fairly general, as both conjunctive query evaluation and
            the basic constraint satisfaction problem are special cases. These new combinatorial and algorithmic results
            are built up on a fundamental connection between query evaluation and Shannon-type inequalities. It was observed
            in different contexts over the past 40 years that information-theoretic inequalities can be used to bound combinatorial
            quantities. First, one can derive (sometimes tight) output size bounds of conjunctive queries and disjunctive
            datalog rules using Shannon-type inequalities. This talk discusses these bounds and techniques. Second, we show
            how one can turn a proof of an information-inequality into an efficient algorithm to evaluate such queries. The
            algorithm’s runtime is bounded by a generalized version of the submodular width of the query, which is optimal
            modulo complexity-theoretic assumptions. </p>

            <a>High-Performance Incremental Processing of Complex Analytical Queries</a>
          </h4>
          <p>Many of today's popular computing applications require real-time analytics over large and dynamic datasets, from
            social web applications to online data warehousing, network monitoring, and algorithmic trading. These applications
            have long-lived analysis queries that require low latency processing over rapidly changing datasets. </p>
          <p>In this talk, I will present techniques for efficient incremental processing of complex analytical queries, ranging
            from classical SQL queries to linear algebra programs. Our system, called DBToaster, compiles declarative database
            queries into high-performance stream processing engines that keep query results (views) fresh at very high update
            rates. DBToaster uses a recursive query compilation algorithm that materializes a supporting set of higher-order
            delta views to achieve a substantially lower view maintenance cost. Our implementation supports batched processing
            in local and distributed environments and can deliver up to 5 orders of magnitude better performance than existing
            DBMS and stream engines.</p>
          <p>The LINVIEW system focuses on the incremental computation of iterative linear algebra programs that consist of
            the standard matrix operations. LINVIEW uses matrix factorization techniques to make the incremental computation
            of standard machine learning algorithms, like linear regression, practical and usually substantially cheaper
            than re-evaluation. LINVIEW generates parallel incremental programs that outperform re-evaluation techniques
            by more than an order of magnitude. </p>

            <a>F1 - The Distributed SQL Database Supporting Google's Ad Business</a>
          </h4>
          <p>Large scale internet operations such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon manage amazing amounts of data. Doing so requires
            databases that are distributed across multiple servers or even multiple data centers, with high throughput, strong
            latency requirements, "five nines" of availability, and often with strict data consistency requirements. This
            talk starts by introducing relational SQL databases, NoSQL databases, and the current state of the art in such
            databases as deployed in industry. It then provides an introduction to Google F1, a SQL database based on Google's
            Spanner distributed storage system. F1 is used to store the data for AdWords, Google's search advertising product,
            as well as several other major products in the Ads &amp; Commerce area. F1 and Spanner represent a new, hybrid
            approach to distributed databases that combines the scalability and availability of NoSQL storage systems like
            Google's Bigtable and Amazon's DynamoDB, with the convenience and consistency guarantees provided by traditional
            SQL relational databases.

          <p>Bart Samwel is a senior staff software engineer at Google. He is infamous at his alma mater Leiden University for
            completing his Master's degree with honors (and with several peer-reviewed publications on his resume), but more
            importantly for taking a full twelve years to do this. It is rumored that this discrepancy has caused him to
            be excluded as an outlier from the Computer Science department graduation statistics. At Google, Bart is a core
            member of the F1 team, working mostly on the F1 SQL query engine.</p>

            <a>Functional Aggregate Queries Asked Frequently (FAQAF)</a>
          </h4>
          <p>We show how a variety of problems from database, logic, probabilistic graphical model (PGM) inference, matrix computation,
            constraint satisfaction (CSP), etc. can be formulated as instances of the same problem called the Functional
            Aggregate Query (FAQ) problem. Then, we explain how a pair of very simple algorithms called OutsideIn and InsideOut
            can be used in concert to solve the FAQ problem. OutsideIn is a slightly more general version of recent worst-case
            optimal join algorithms. InsideOut is a slightly more general version of the classic variable elimination algorithm.
          </p>
          <p>As is the case with constraint programming and graphical model inference, to make InsideOut run efficiently we
            need to solve an optimization problem to compute an appropriate variable ordering. The main technical contribution
            of this work is a precise characterization of when a variable ordering is "semantically equivalent" to the variable
            ordering given by the input FAQ expression. Then, we design an approximation algorithm to find an equivalent
            variable ordering that has the best "fractional FAQ-width". Our results imply a host of known and a few new results
            in graphical model inference, matrix operations, relational joins, and logic.

            <a>Parallel Query Evaluation</a>
          </h4>
          <p>Fix a full, conjunctive query, and consider the following problem: what is the amount of communication required
            to compute the query in parallel, on p servers, over a large database instance? We define the Massively Parallel
            Communication (MPC) model, where the computation proceeds in rounds consisting of local computations followed
            by a global reshuffling of the data. Servers have unlimited computational power and are allowed to exchange any
            data, the only cost parameters are the number of rounds and the maximum amount of communication per server. I
            will describe tight bounds on the amount of communication for the case of a single round and data without skew,
            then discuss extensions to skewed data and multiround.</p>

            <a>Query Compilation: the View from the Database Side</a>
          </h4>
          <p>We study knowledge compilation for Boolean formulas that are given as groundings of First Order formulas. This
            problem is motivated by probabilistic databases, where each record in the database is an independent probabilistic
            event, and the query is given by a SQL expression or, equivalently, a First Order formula. The query's probability
            can be computed in linear time in the size of the compilation representation, hence the interest in studying
            the size of such a representation. We consider the "data complexity" setting, where the query is fixed, and the
            input to the problem consists only of the database instance. We consider several compilation targets, of increasing
            expressive power: OBDDs, FBDDs, and decision-DNNFs (a subclass of d-DNNFs). For the case of OBDDs we establish
            a dichotomy theorem for queries in restricted languages FO(exists, wedge, ee) and FO(orall, wedge, ee): for
            each such query the OBDD is either linear in the size of the database, or grows exponentially, and the complexity
            can be determined through a simple analysis of the query expression. For the other targets we describe a class
            of queries for which (a) the decision-DNNF is exponentially large in the size of the database, and (b) the probability
            of the query can be computed in polynomial time in the size of the database. This suggests that the compilation
            target decision-DNNF is too weak to capture all tractable cases of probabilistic inference. Our lower bound for
            decision-DNNF's relies on a translation into FBDD's, which is of independent interest.</p>

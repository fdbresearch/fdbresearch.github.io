                                        Over the past 30 years, the world of data management has undergone a dramatic evolution, allowing us to consider an increasingly wide range of data types, sources, and processing models. This has also led to the collection of tremendous volumes of data, and we are now at a point where almost every aspect of our lives is data-driven. In this talk, Prof. Tova Milo will share her perspective on some of the "hot topics" that she has been personally involved with in this evolution, and discuss why certain research topics become popular and when they lose their relevance. She will furthermore argue that we are now facing a turning point where the deluge of data has become a serious risk, and that the next "hot" research agenda should focus on data disposal.

                                        Modern data analytics requires iteration, yet relational database engines are mostly optimized for non-recursive queries.  SQL supports only a limited form of recursion.  A better formalism for recursive queries is datalog, which has some elegant properties (recursion always terminates), and led to the development of two powerful optimizations techniques: semi-naive evaluation, and magic set rewriting.  But standard datalog is restricted to monotone queries over sets and does not support aggregates, which has limited its adoption.

                                        The scientific field of geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) was recently
                                        formed from combining innovations in spatial science with the rapid growth of
                                        methods in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning (e.g.,
                                        deep learning), data mining, and high-performance computing to glean meaningful

                                        Information Extraction (IE) is the task of extracting structured information
                                        from textual data. We
                                        explore a programming paradigm that is supported by several IE systems where
                                        relations extracted by
                                        atomic extractors undergo a relational manipulation. In our efforts toward
                                        achieving a better
                                        understanding of IE systems, we study the computational complexity of queries in
                                        the framework of
                                        document spanners (spanners, for short) that was introduced by Fagin et al. A
                                        spanner is a function that
                                        extracts from a document (string) a relation over text intervals, called spans,
                                        using either atomic
                                        extractors or a relational algebra query on top of these extractors. Evaluating
                                        a spanner on a document
                                        is a computational problem that involves three components: the atomic
                                        extractors, the relational
                                        structure of the query, and the document. We investigate the complexity of this
                                        problem from various
                                        angles, each keeping some components fixed and regarding the rest as input.

                                        We discuss the complexity of enumerating the answers of Unions of Conjunctive
                                        Queries (UCQs), and focus
                                        on the ability to list output tuples with constant delay following linear-time
                                        preprocessing. A known
                                        dichotomy classifies the self-join-free CQs into those that admit such
                                        enumeration, and those that do
                                        not. However, this classification no longer holds in the common case where the
                                        database exhibits
                                        dependencies among attributes. In such cases, some queries classified as hard
                                        are in fact tractable, and
                                        we generalize the dichotomy to accommodate Functional Dependencies (FDs). Next,
                                        we aspire to have a
                                        similar characterization for UCQs, even when there are no FDs. It was claimed in
                                        the past that a UCQ is
                                        hard if one of its queries is hard. We examine the task of enumerating UCQs, and
                                        show that some unions
                                        containing a hard query are tractable. In fact, a UCQ may be tractable even if
                                        it does not contain a
                                        single tractable CQ.

                                        Since 2009, we have been developing and operating Cloud-deployed, hybrid
                                        transactional/analytic
                                        processing (HTAP) systems for large retail customers. We implement these
                                        applications primarily in a
                                        datalog-based language called LogiQL, which permits the concise expression of
                                        rich models with powerful
                                        constraints and business rules. The ability to build such systems at scale in
                                        LogiQL owes to a number
                                        of innovations in the LogicBlox platform, including advanced multi-way join
                                        algorithms, powerful query
                                        optimizations, write-optimized data structures, and the ability to harness the
                                        parallelism available in
                                        modern servers. Unfortunately, not every LogiQL program can (yet) take full
                                        advantage of these
                                        innovations. When tuning such a program, a developer will often rewrite parts of
                                        the program to
                                        introduce new predicates and rules that materialize intermediate results.
                                        Inevitably, these rewrites
                                        have a deleterious effect on the concision, readability, and maintainability of
                                        a program. In practice,
                                        we mitigate these challenges through optimization heuristics and by generating a
                                        significant component
                                        of the LogiQL program from a higher-level form (called CubiQL) that allows us to
                                        automate their
                                        application. This talk surveys the challenges that arise when using LogiQL to
                                        build HTAP applications
                                        in this domain and the heuristics we developed to address them. We conclude with
                                        open problems that
                                        remain difficult to automate.

                                        Performing data analytics on huge data sets have been very crucial for many
                                        enterprises. It was
                                        facilitated by the introduction of the MapReduce programming and execution model
                                        and other more recent
                                        distributed computing platforms. MapReduce users often have analysis tasks that
                                        are too complex to
                                        express as individual MapReduce jobs, and therefore they use high-level query
                                        languages such as Pig or
                                        Hive to express their complex tasks. The compilers of these languages translate
                                        queries into workflows
                                        of MapReduce jobs. In my talk, I will present ReStore, a system that manages the
                                        storage and reuse of
                                        intermediate results between MapReduce jobs in such workflows. At the end of the
                                        talk, I will briefly
                                        discuss related ideas for optimizing queries executed on other distributed
                                        computing platforms.

                                        systems, turning long-running jobs into interactive queries. However, the

                                        tuning techniques creates a design-space that is hard to navigate for a skilled

                                        and even harder to exploit for modern, code-generating data processing systems.

                                        Relational queries, and in particular join queries, often generate large output

                                        over a huge dataset.
                                        In such cases, it is often infeasible to store the whole materialized output if

                                        This talk considers a method for compressing graphs into a smaller graph grammar
                                        based on the RePair
                                        compression scheme.
                                        We start by defining the necessary notion of context-free hyperedge replacement
                                        grammars using
                                        examples.
                                        We then extend RePair to graphs using this grammar formalism and discuss how the
                                        problem of finding
                                        non-overlapping
                                        occurrences appears more difficult on graphs than on strings and trees....

                                        construction is lagging behind
                                        that in the compilers field. We attempt to remedy this by exploring the key
                                        causes of technical
                                        challenges
                                        in need of well-founded solutions, and by gathering the most relevant ideas and
                                        approaches from the PL

                                        We study planning in Markov decision processes involving discrete and continuous
                                        states and actions,
                                        and an unknown number
                                        of objects. Planning in such domains is notoriously challenging and often
                                        requires restrictive
                                        assumptions.
                                        We introduce HYPE: a sample-based planner for hybrid domains that is very
                                        general, which combines
                                        model-based
                                        approaches with state abstraction. Most significantly, the domains where such
                                        planners are deployed are
                                        usually
                                        very complex with deep structural and geometric constraints. HYPE is

                                        I will talk about algorithmic and theoretical aspects of an adaptive clustering

                                        scenarios. First, I'll give an
                                        introduction
                                        to the centralized clustering methods in a standard stochastic noise setting for
                                        networked users on the

                                        Next, in the decentralized clustering setting I'll describe two distributed
                                        efficient algorithms for
                                        solving

                                        matrix computation,
                                        constraint satisfaction (CSP), etc. can be formulated as instances of the same
                                        problem called the
                                        Functional
                                        Aggregate Query (FAQ) problem. Then, we explain how a pair of very simple
                                        algorithms called OutsideIn
                                        and
                                        InsideOut can be used in concert to solve the FAQ problem. OutsideIn is a
                                        slightly more general version
                                        of
                                        recent worst-case optimal join algorithms. InsideOut is a slightly more general
                                        version of the classic

                         Over the past 30 years, the world of data management has undergone a dramatic evolution, allowing us to consider an increasingly wide range of data types, sources, and processing models. This has also led to the collection of tremendous volumes of data, and we are now at a point where almost every aspect of our lives is data-driven. In this talk, Prof. Tova Milo will share her perspective on some of the "hot topics" that she has been personally involved with in this evolution, and discuss why certain research topics become popular and when they lose their relevance. She will furthermore argue that we are now facing a turning point where the deluge of data has become a serious risk, and that the next "hot" research agenda should focus on data disposal.

                         Despite advances in storage technology, the amount of data generated is projected to surpass storage production by an order of magnitude by 2025, and uncontrolled data retention further poses significant risks to security and privacy. She will discuss the logical, algorithmic, and methodological foundations necessary for the systematic disposal of large-scale data, highlighting new research challenges and the potential for reusing existing techniques. She will also share insights from the research conducted by the Tel Aviv Databases group in this direction. Ultimately, managing data effectively while respecting storage, processing, and regulatory constraints is a significant challenge, and she looks forward to exploring this topic further in her talk.

                         Modern data analytics requires iteration, yet relational database engines are mostly optimized for non-recursive queries.  SQL supports only a limited form of recursion.  A better formalism for recursive queries is datalog, which has some elegant properties (recursion always terminates), and led to the development of two powerful optimizations techniques: semi-naive evaluation, and magic set rewriting.  But standard datalog is restricted to monotone queries over sets and does not support aggregates, which has limited its adoption.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         In this talk I will describe a new approach to recursive queries and their optimization.  First, we extend datalog to semirings, while preserving some of the elegant properties of datalog, and also supporting aggregates naturally.  Then, I will describe a simple, yet very powerful optimization rule, called the FGH rule, that rewrites a recursive program into a different recursive program.  The rule captures many optimizations discussed in the literature, such as magic set optimization, the PreM rule, and semi-naive evaluation, and as well as new semantics optimizations.  Our implementation of the FGH rule is based on the egg term rewriting engine, and the Rosette program synthesizer.

                         The scientific field of geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) was recently formed from
                         combining innovations in spatial science with the rapid growth of methods in artificial
                         intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning (e.g., deep learning), data mining, and
                         high-performance computing to glean meaningful information from spatial big data. GeoAI is an
                         interdisciplinary field, spanning several scientific subjects including computer science,
                         engineering, statistics, and spatial science. In this seminar talk, we will explore current
                         research work undergoing at Ordnance Survey and partner universities in unlocking the potential
                         of GeoAI in the connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) sector.

                    <p>
                         SQL-on-Hadoop, NewSQL and NoSQL databases provide semi-structured data models (typically
                         JSON-based). They now
                         drive towards declarative, SQL-alike query languages. However, their idiomatic, non-SQL
                         language constructs,
                         the many variations and the lack of formal syntax and semantics pose problems. Notably,
                         database vendors end
                         up with unclear semantics and complicated implementations, as they add one feature at-a-time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         The presented SQL++ semi-structured data model bridges semistructured data and the SQL data
                         model. The SQL++
                         query language aims to backwards compatibility with SQL. We show that a relatively small set of
                         SQL
                         restriction removals and feature additions is enough to provide a SQL-compatible extension to
                         semistructured
                         data. SQL++ is currently being adopted by the industry.

                    <p>
                         The extension to Configurable SQL++ includes configuration options that describe different
                         options of language
                         semantics and formally capture the variations of existing database languages. Configurable
                         SQL++ is unifying:
                         By appropriate choices of configuration options, the Configurable SQL++ semantics can morph
                         into the semantics
                         of any of eleven popular semistructured databases, which we surveyed, as the experimental
                         validation shows. In
                         this way, Configurable SQL++ allows a formal characterization of the capabilities of the
                         emerging query
                         languages.

                         classifies the self-join-free CQs into those that admit such enumeration, and those that do

                         classification no longer holds in the common case where the database exhibits dependencies

                         the task of enumerating UCQs, and show that some unions containing a hard query are tractable.
                         In fact, a UCQ

                         Information Extraction (IE) is the task of extracting structured information from textual data.
                         We explore a
                         programming paradigm that is supported by several IE systems where relations extracted by
                         atomic extractors
                         undergo a relational manipulation. In our efforts toward achieving a better understanding of IE
                         systems, we
                         study the computational complexity of queries in the framework of document spanners (spanners,
                         for short) that
                         was introduced by Fagin et al. A spanner is a function that extracts from a document (string) a
                         relation over
                         text intervals, called spans, using either atomic extractors or a relational algebra query on
                         top of these
                         extractors. Evaluating a spanner on a document is a computational problem that involves three
                         components: the
                         atomic extractors, the relational structure of the query, and the document. We investigate the
                         complexity of
                         this problem from various angles, each keeping some components fixed and regarding the rest as

                              Practical challenges to building large applications written in a datalog-based language

                    <p>
                         Since 2009, we have been developing and operating Cloud-deployed, hybrid transactional/analytic
                         processing
                         (HTAP) systems for large retail customers. We implement these applications primarily in a
                         datalog-based
                         language called LogiQL, which permits the concise expression of rich models with powerful
                         constraints and
                         business rules. The ability to build such systems at scale in LogiQL owes to a number of
                         innovations in the
                         LogicBlox platform, including advanced multi-way join algorithms, powerful query optimizations,
                         write-optimized data structures, and the ability to harness the parallelism available in modern
                         servers.
                         Unfortunately, not every LogiQL program can (yet) take full advantage of these innovations.
                         When tuning such
                         a program, a developer will often rewrite parts of the program to introduce new predicates and
                         rules that
                         materialize intermediate results. Inevitably, these rewrites have a deleterious effect on the
                         concision,
                         readability, and maintainability of a program. In practice, we mitigate these challenges
                         through optimization
                         heuristics and by generating a significant component of the LogiQL program from a higher-level
                         form (called
                         CubiQL) that allows us to automate their application. This talk surveys the challenges that
                         arise when using
                         LogiQL to build HTAP applications in this domain and the heuristics we developed to address
                         them. We conclude
                         with open problems that remain difficult to automate.

                    <p>
                         Performing data analytics on huge data sets have been very crucial for many enterprises. It was
                         facilitated
                         by the introduction of the MapReduce programming and execution model and other more recent
                         distributed
                         computing platforms. MapReduce users often have analysis tasks that are too complex to express
                         as individual
                         MapReduce jobs, and therefore they use high-level query languages such as Pig or Hive to
                         express their
                         complex tasks. The compilers of these languages translate queries into workflows of MapReduce
                         jobs. In my
                         talk, I will present ReStore, a system that manages the storage and reuse of intermediate
                         results between
                         MapReduce jobs in such workflows. At the end of the talk, I will briefly discuss related ideas
                         for optimizing
                         queries executed on other distributed computing platforms.

                         Hardware-conscious database systems evaluate queries in milliseconds that take minutes in
                         conventional
                         systems, turning long-running jobs into interactive queries. However, the plethora of
                         hardware-focused tuning
                         techniques creates a design-space that is hard to navigate for a skilled performance engineer
                         and even harder
                         to exploit for modern, code-generating data processing systems. In addition, hardware-conscious
                         tuning is
                         often at odds with other design goals such as implementation effort, ease of use and
                         maintainability -- in
                         particular when developing code-generating database systems. Well-designed programming
                         abstractions are
                         essential to allow the creation of systems that are fast, easy to use and maintainable.

                         In my talk, I demonstrate how existing frameworks for high-performance, data-parallel
                         programming fall short
                         of this goal. I argue that the poor performance of many mainstream data processing systems is
                         due to the lack
                         of an appropriate intermediate abstraction layer, i.e., one that is amenable to both,
                         traditional
                         data-oriented as well as low-level hardware-focused optimizations.

                         To address this problem, I introduce Voodoo, a data parallel intermediate language that is
                         abstract enough to
                         allow effective code generation and optimization but low-level enough to express many common
                         optimizations
                         such as parallelization, loop tiling or memory locality optimizations. I demonstrate how we
                         used Voodoo to
                         build a relational data processing system that outperforms the fastest state-of-the-art
                         in-memory database
                         systems by up to five times. I also demonstrate how Voodoo can be used as a performance
                         engineering
                         framework, allowing the expression of many known optimizations and even enabling the discovery
                         of entirely
                         new optimizations.

                    <p>
                         Relational queries, and in particular join queries, often generate large output results when
                         executed over a
                         huge dataset.
                         In such cases, it is often infeasible to store the whole materialized output if we plan to
                         reuse it further
                         down
                         a data processing pipeline. In this talk, we consider the problem of constructing
                         space-efficient compressed
                         representations
                         of the output of conjunctive queries, with the goal of supporting the efficient access of the
                         intermediate
                         compressed
                         result for a given access pattern. In particular, we will study of an important tradeoff :
                         minimizing the
                         space
                         necessary to store the compressed result, versus minimizing the answer time and delay for an
                         access request
                         over
                         the result. We present a novel parameterized data structure, which can be tuned to trade off
                         space for answer
                         time.
                         This tradeoff allows us to control the space requirement of the data structure precisely, and
                         depends both on
                         the
                         structure of the query and the access pattern. We then show how we can use the data structure
                         in conjunction
                         with
                         query decomposition techniques, in order to efficiently represent the outputs for several
                         classes of
                         conjunctive
                         queries. Finally, we conclude with some exciting open problems in this area.

                         example, it removes much of the complexity of multi-core programming. It also enables a new
                         approach to
                         programming
                         large database applications, especially those requiring complex prescriptive and descriptive

                         An early vision in Computer Science has been to create intelligent systems capable of reasoning
                         on large
                         amounts of data.
                         Today, this vision can be delivered by integrating Relational Databases with the Semantic Web
                         using the W3C
                         standards:
                         a graph data model (RDF), ontology language (OWL), mapping language (R2RML) and query language
                         (SPARQL). The
                         research
                         community has successfully been showing how intelligent systems can be created with Semantic
                         Web
                         technologies,
                         dubbed now as Knowledge Graphs.

                         However, where is the mainstream industry adoption? What are the barriers to adoption? Are
                         these engineering
                         and social barriers
                         or are they open scientific problems that need to be addressed?

                              This talk considers a method for compressing graphs into a smaller graph grammar based on
                              the RePair
                              compression
                              scheme. We start by defining the necessary notion of context-free hyperedge replacement
                              grammars using
                              examples.
                              We then extend RePair to graphs using this grammar formalism and discuss how the problem
                              of finding
                              non-overlapping
                              occurrences appears more difficult on graphs than on strings and trees.

                         <p>
                              We also give some intuition on graphs that are difficult to compress with HR grammars,
                              present some
                              experimental results
                              based on a proof-of-concept implementation, and briefly mention how to navigate the
                              represented data
                              without
                              decompression.

                              In this talk, we study architecting query compilers. The state of the art in query
                              compiler construction
                              is lagging
                              behind that in the compilers field. We attempt to remedy this by exploring the key causes
                              of technical
                              challenges
                              in need of well-founded solutions, and by gathering the most relevant ideas and approaches
                              from the PL and
                              compilers
                              communities for easy digestion by database researchers. All query compilers known to us
                              are more or less
                              monolithic
                              template expanders that do the bulk of the compilation task in one large leap. Such
                              systems are hard to
                              build
                              and maintain. We propose to use a stack of multiple DSLs on different levels of
                              abstraction with lowering
                              in
                              multiple steps to make query compilers easier to build and extend, ultimately allowing us
                              to create more
                              convincing
                              and sustainable compiler-based data management systems. We attempt to derive our advice
                              for creating such
                              DSL
                              stacks from widely accepted principles. We have also re-created a well-known query
                              compiler following these
                              ideas
                              and report on this effort.

                              In this talk, we show that the full materialization of results is a barrier for more
                              general optimization
                              strategies.
                              In particular, we present a new approach for evaluating queries under updates. Instead of
                              the
                              materialization
                              of results, we require a data structure that allows: (1) linear time maintenance under
                              updates, (2)
                              constant-delay
                              enumeration of the output, (3) constant-time lookups in the output, while (4) using only
                              linear space in
                              the
                              size of the database. We call such a structure a Dynamic Constant delay Linear
                              Representation (DCLR) for
                              the
                              query. We show that Dyn, a dynamic version of the Yannakakis algorithm, yields DCLRs for
                              the class of
                              free-connex
                              acyclic CQs. We show that this is optimal in the sense that no DCLR can exist for CQs that
                              are not
                              free-connex
                              acyclic. Moreover, we identify a sub-class of queries for which Dyn features constant-time
                              update per tuple
                              and
                              show that this class is maximal. An experimental validation of Dyn shows that it is highly
                              effective in
                              practice.

                              The talk will conclude with current insights on ongoing research on how Dyn can be
                              extended to also allow
                              processing
                              of more general classes of queries, in particular queries that feature in-equality joins
                              rather than
                              equality
                              joins. Such in-equality joins are important in relational-style queries, but are also
                              prominently present
                              in
                              the area of Complex Event Recognition.

                                   Decision-theoretic planning via probabilistic programming

                         <p>
                              We study planning in Markov decision processes involving discrete and continuous states
                              and actions, and
                              an unknown
                              number of objects. Planning in such domains is notoriously challenging and often requires
                              restrictive
                              assumptions.
                              We introduce HYPE: a sample-based planner for hybrid domains that is very general, which
                              combines
                              model-based
                              approaches with state abstraction. Most significantly, the domains where such planners are
                              deployed are
                              usually
                              very complex with deep structural and geometric constraints. HYPE is instantiated in a
                              probabilistic
                              programming
                              language that allows compact codification of such constraints.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              In our empirical evaluations, we show that HYPE is a general and widely applicable planner
                              in domains
                              ranging from
                              strictly discrete to strictly continuous to hybrid ones. Moreover, empirical results
                              showed that
                              abstraction
                              provides significant improvements.

                              In the final part of the talk, we turn to the question of whether there is any hope of
                              developing
                              computational
                              methodologies that are not based on sampling. In particular, it is tricky in hybrid
                              domains to deal with
                              low-probability
                              observations, and most sampling-based schemes only provide asymptotic guarantees.

                              This talk overviews recent results on bounding the output size and on efficiently
                              evaluating a disjunctive
                              datalog
                              rule, given input statistics such as relation sizes, functional dependencies, and degree
                              bounds. These are
                              the
                              kind of statistics prevalent in database query evaluation, and our results apply to
                              aggregate queries as
                              well.
                              The disjunctive datalog query evaluation problem is fairly general, as both conjunctive
                              query evaluation
                              and
                              the basic constraint satisfaction problem are special cases. These new combinatorial and
                              algorithmic
                              results
                              are built up on a fundamental connection between query evaluation and Shannon-type
                              inequalities. It was
                              observed
                              in different contexts over the past 40 years that information-theoretic inequalities can
                              be used to bound
                              combinatorial
                              quantities. First, one can derive (sometimes tight) output size bounds of conjunctive
                              queries and
                              disjunctive
                              datalog rules using Shannon-type inequalities. This talk discusses these bounds and
                              techniques. Second, we
                              show
                              how one can turn a proof of an information-inequality into an efficient algorithm to
                              evaluate such queries.
                              The
                              algorithm’s runtime is bounded by a generalized version of the submodular width of the
                              query, which is
                              optimal
                              modulo complexity-theoretic assumptions.

                              Next, in the decentralized clustering setting I'll describe two distributed efficient

                         <p>
                              Many of today's popular computing applications require real-time analytics over large and
                              dynamic
                              datasets, from
                              social web applications to online data warehousing, network monitoring, and algorithmic
                              trading. These
                              applications
                              have long-lived analysis queries that require low latency processing over rapidly changing
                              datasets.

                              In this talk, I will present techniques for efficient incremental processing of complex
                              analytical
                              queries, ranging
                              from classical SQL queries to linear algebra programs. Our system, called DBToaster,
                              compiles declarative
                              database
                              queries into high-performance stream processing engines that keep query results (views)
                              fresh at very high
                              update
                              rates. DBToaster uses a recursive query compilation algorithm that materializes a
                              supporting set of
                              higher-order
                              delta views to achieve a substantially lower view maintenance cost. Our implementation
                              supports batched
                              processing
                              in local and distributed environments and can deliver up to 5 orders of magnitude better
                              performance than
                              existing
                              DBMS and stream engines.

                              The LINVIEW system focuses on the incremental computation of iterative linear algebra
                              programs that
                              consist of
                              the standard matrix operations. LINVIEW uses matrix factorization techniques to make the
                              incremental
                              computation
                              of standard machine learning algorithms, like linear regression, practical and usually
                              substantially
                              cheaper
                              than re-evaluation. LINVIEW generates parallel incremental programs that outperform
                              re-evaluation
                              techniques
                              by more than an order of magnitude.

                              Large scale internet operations such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon manage amazing
                              amounts of data. Doing
                              so requires
                              databases that are distributed across multiple servers or even multiple data centers, with
                              high throughput,
                              strong
                              latency requirements, "five nines" of availability, and often with strict data consistency
                              requirements.
                              This
                              talk starts by introducing relational SQL databases, NoSQL databases, and the current

                              databases as deployed in industry. It then provides an introduction to Google F1, a SQL

                              We show how a variety of problems from database, logic, probabilistic graphical model
                              (PGM) inference,
                              matrix computation,
                              constraint satisfaction (CSP), etc. can be formulated as instances of the same problem
                              called the
                              Functional
                              Aggregate Query (FAQ) problem. Then, we explain how a pair of very simple algorithms
                              called OutsideIn and
                              InsideOut
                              can be used in concert to solve the FAQ problem. OutsideIn is a slightly more general
                              version of recent
                              worst-case
                              optimal join algorithms. InsideOut is a slightly more general version of the classic
                              variable elimination
                              algorithm.

                              As is the case with constraint programming and graphical model inference, to make
                              InsideOut run
                              efficiently we
                              need to solve an optimization problem to compute an appropriate variable ordering. The
                              main technical
                              contribution
                              of this work is a precise characterization of when a variable ordering is "semantically
                              equivalent" to the
                              variable
                              ordering given by the input FAQ expression. Then, we design an approximation algorithm to
                              find an
                              equivalent
                              variable ordering that has the best "fractional FAQ-width". Our results imply a host of
                              known and a few new
                              results
                              in graphical model inference, matrix operations, relational joins, and logic.

                              followed
                              by a global reshuffling of the data. Servers have unlimited computational power and are
                              allowed to exchange
                              any
                              data, the only cost parameters are the number of rounds and the maximum amount of
                              communication per server.
                              I
                              will describe tight bounds on the amount of communication for the case of a single round
                              and data without
                              skew,
                              then discuss extensions to skewed data and multiround.

                         <p>
                              We study knowledge compilation for Boolean formulas that are given as groundings of First
                              Order formulas.
                              This
                              problem is motivated by probabilistic databases, where each record in the database is an
                              independent
                              probabilistic
                              event, and the query is given by a SQL expression or, equivalently, a First Order formula.
                              The query's
                              probability
                              can be computed in linear time in the size of the compilation representation, hence the
                              interest in
                              studying
                              the size of such a representation. We consider the "data complexity" setting, where the
                              query is fixed, and
                              the
                              input to the problem consists only of the database instance. We consider several
                              compilation targets, of
                              increasing
                              expressive power: OBDDs, FBDDs, and decision-DNNFs (a subclass of d-DNNFs). For the case
                              of OBDDs we
                              establish
                              a dichotomy theorem for queries in restricted languages FO(exists, wedge, ee) and
                              FO(orall, wedge, ee):
                              for
                              each such query the OBDD is either linear in the size of the database, or grows
                              exponentially, and the
                              complexity
                              can be determined through a simple analysis of the query expression. For the other targets
                              we describe a
                              class
                              of queries for which (a) the decision-DNNF is exponentially large in the size of the
                              database, and (b) the
                              probability
                              of the query can be computed in polynomial time in the size of the database. This suggests
                              that the
                              compilation
                              target decision-DNNF is too weak to capture all tractable cases of probabilistic
                              inference. Our lower bound
                              for
                              decision-DNNF's relies on a translation into FBDD's, which is of independent interest.

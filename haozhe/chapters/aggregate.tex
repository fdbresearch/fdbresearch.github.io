\chapter{Aggregates}

% what is aggregates
% impoertant
% application

% lowest known computational complexity

\section{Aggregate over Factorised join}
% example

% [BKOZ13]
% group-by => free variables should sit on the top of the variable order => FAQ width
% FAQ width is at least fhtw

% It is not necessary to compute the factorised-join result before computing the aggregates
% aggregate variables follow the variable order 

% push the sums over the products

\section{Functional Aggregate Queries (FAQs)}

% FAQ generalises factorises aggregate computation to a host of problems

% the notation of the FAQ
% convert an aggregates to a function with input and output
% The input
% the output: a function

% semiring
% laws and examples

% examples
% boolean
% matrix


% \textbf{Insideout}

% same complexity with the FDB aggregate

% FDB: top down
% FAQ: bottom up

% need variable order

% we can output both listing representation / factorised representation

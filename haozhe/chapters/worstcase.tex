\chapter{Worst-case optimal join algorithms}

% What are worst-case optimal join algorithms

% when we have the upper bound of the join results, do we have the algorithm for computing the join results with the complexity linear to these bounds?

% Introduce the algorithms which are worst-case optimal

\section{Listing Representations}


% Commercial databases often process a join query by breaking a complex multiway join into a series of \textbf{pairwise joins}
% The reason that the previous algorithms are suboptimal is the old enemy of the database optimiser: skew

% The two important ideas of the worst-case optimal join algorithms
% 1. avoiding skew
% 2. one join at a time
